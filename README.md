# **Cemu - Mouse fork**
## what is this
i merged cellos51's [patch](https://github.com/cellos51/CemuInkAim/tree/ab44c856bd29a742144b910d2d2b6cc83b2b97a6) to add mouse support to cemu with the latest commit and built it
## why?
the build in cellos51's repo was too old to connect to pretendo and i wanted to try it online
## how do i use this?
once you've loaded the game, press f1 to capture your mouse, you will now be able to controll the camera by moving the mouse. left click = zr and right click = r. you can press tab to see the gamepad's screen to see the map and super jump.
## future plans (not gonna happen)
- add a way to adjust sensitivity
- turn this into a pull request for cemu (def not gonna happen)
